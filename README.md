# Tic Tac Toe

## Technologies Used
I used HTML to make the base structure of my SPA, CSS for the styling,
javascript for the game engine, and jquery and ajax to manipulate the DOM and
event handlers.

## Development Process
I started my process with HTML first because I wanted to get the structure of my
page down as soon as possible, and also because I thought it was the easiest to
accomplish. Also my event handlers would have to draw on the classes and id's of
what is on there. So naturally I then completed my CSS work as well to
correspond with how I wanted my game to look like. The javascript was a hard
part, but not the hardest.
