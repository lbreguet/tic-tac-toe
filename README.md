## Technologies Used
I used HTML to make the base structure of my SPA, CSS for the styling,
javascript for the game engine, and jquery and ajax to manipulate the DOM and
event handlers.

## Development Process
I started my process with HTML first because I wanted to get the structure of my
page down as soon as possible, and also because I thought it was the easiest to
accomplish. Also my event handlers would have to draw on the classes and id's of
what is on there. So naturally I then completed my CSS work as well to
correspond with how I wanted my game to look like. The javascript was a hard
part, but not the hardest. I had to create the board of empty strings. Then I
to make `if` statements for the win parameters going back in forth through 'X'
and 'O'. Then I had to make a rule to switch in between between players. Then

=======
my game needed to actually run with a click handler on the individual cells. My
reset game function erases the text strings on the board and restarts the game
function as well. The hardest process of this game was initiailizing the game
API, getting patch to work and show the game history. Because of the way I set
my game with the click handler being in the game engine I had to set up `PATCH`
in my game engine and not in the events. The sign out and sign in functionality
was not as difficult as I thought it would be. But through these steps, my game
works.

## Changes I Could Make
There are many changes that I would make to my game. One thing is that when a
new user signs up, there information is still in the input when they sign back
out. I don't know how to change this yet, but I update that soon enough. This is
actually the same for all of the inputs. Another thing that could be changed is
when a user presses the new game button and then presses game history, their new
game is counted towards it, regardless of whether it was completed or not. It's
a minor issue, but an issue none the less.
